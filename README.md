Aviation safety has long been shaped by a cycle of tragedy, investigation, and reform. From catastrophic mechanical failures to pilot error and regulatory lapses, every major air disaster serves as a turning point in the industry’s pursuit of safer skies. Only after mounting public pressure and significant accidents did regulators implement more stringent protocols, reinforcing the reactive nature of aviation policy. This project was created by UCLA students for Digital Humanities 101, which focuses on forming human-centered research questions based on structured data, and using various digital tools to answer these questions. This specific flight safety project examines the evolution of aviation safety through historical case studies, statistical analyses, and economic correlations. By analyzing key aviation disasters, regulatory responses, and ongoing challenges—such as corporate accountability, technological advancements, and economic inequality—this research aims to provide a comprehensive understan
